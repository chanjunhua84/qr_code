    Once upon a time, there was a little red hen who lived on a farm. 
    She was friends with a lazy dog, a sleepy cat, and a noisy duck.

    One day, she found some wheat seeds and asked her friends, 
    "Who will help me plant these wheat seeds?"

    "Not I," said the dog.
    "Not I," said the cat.
    "Not I," said the duck.
